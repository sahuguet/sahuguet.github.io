## Favorite quotes
> "They \[LLMs\] are dream machines. We direct their dreams with prompts."

> "As an analogy, artificial flight does not involve the kinds of things that are used to achieve flight by animals in non-human ecosystems. The goals of aeronautical engineers are not those of zoologists. Their methods and aims diverge accordingly."
