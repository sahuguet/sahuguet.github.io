* [liteLLM](https://www.litellm.ai/)
* [LibreChat](https://www.librechat.ai/)
* [repo2vec](https://github.com/Storia-AI/repo2vec)

## Prompt Engineering
WARNING: shelf-life is short as new models get better every day.
* [Prompt Engineering Guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/) 
* [Impressive collection of prompt patterns](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/tree/main/patterns) (from [Fabric project](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/tree/main))
* [Non-Obvious Prompt Engineering Guide](https://www.techsistence.com/p/non-obvious-prompt-engineering-guide) (Tech-sistence, July 2024)

## Performance evaluation
WARNING: this is a hard problem; most approaches are too generic and do not answer the question "which is model is best for **you**".
* [Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM)](https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/)
* [LMSYS Chatbot Arena](https://lmarena.ai/)

## Relevant quotes
> "They \[LLMs\] are dream machines. We direct their dreams with prompts."

Source: https://x.com/karpathy/status/1733299213503787018?lang=en
> "As an analogy, artificial flight does not involve the kinds of things that are used to achieve flight by animals in non-human ecosystems. The goals of aeronautical engineers are not those of zoologists. Their methods and aims diverge accordingly."

Source: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08790

> Electric motors are a general-purpose technology, but you don’t buy a box of electric motors from Home Depot - you buy a drill, a washing machine and a blender. A general-purpose technology is instantiated as use-cases.

> "\[…\] the problem with Alchemy of yore was not that Chemistry is useless, but that people wanted to delude themselves that Chemistry – a pretty amazing discipline on its own merits –
can be Nuclear Physics if you prompt it just so."
