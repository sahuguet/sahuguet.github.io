New website, new blog.

Here is my previous history with blogs:
* [The other side of the Firewall](https://sahuguet.wordpress.com/), hosted at Wordpress, when I was at Bell-Labs.
* [Medium](https://medium.com/@sahuguet).
* and today Github pages.

What you should expect from this blog?
* some long form articles about interesting topics I want to talk about
* some short bits about tools or experiments I find worthy of sharing

Comments are always welcome.
