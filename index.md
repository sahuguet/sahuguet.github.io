My passion is to invent, architect and build products that leverage technology to solve meaningful problems and have a large social impact. I aim at empowering people and organizations to be more productive and collaborative through innovation.


I am currently working for the Jacobs Institute at Cornell Tech where I am the project lead for the Urban Tech hub.
