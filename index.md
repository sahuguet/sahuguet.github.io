# About Me
<img style="float: right; max-width:20%; border-radius:50%;" src="img/profile-picture.jpg">

My passion is to invent, architect and build products that leverage technology to solve mean- ingful problems and have a large social impact. I aim at empowering people and organizations to be more productive and collaborative through innovation.

My areas of expertise include data – big, small, open, geographic – management and anal- ysis, architecture of complex systems, product design and research & development.

I am currently working for the Jacobs Institute at Cornell Tech where I am the project lead for the Urban Tech hub.

# User-facing products I have launched

## ZXing (open source 1D/2D barcode image processing for Android)
When I stated at Google coming from Bell Labs, I was very curious and excited about the QR-code technology.
I played a few existing solutions ...
I convinced some Google software engineers to work on generic library as a 20% project.
Inspired the development of [Google Lens](https://lens.google.com/).

## GOOG-411 (Google, 2007)
GOOG-411 (or Google Voice Local Search) was a telephone service launched by Google in 2007, that provided a speech-recognition-based business directory search, and placed a call to the resulting number in the United States or Canada.[1] The service was accessible via a toll-free telephone number.

The motive behind GOOG-411 was to acquire enough voice data to train Google-own speech-recognition engine. A voice local search service was picked because it was doable (via Google Local Search), useful for people and provided a great coverage of the english language in terms of utterances.

## Google Audio Indexing aka GAudi (Google, 2008)
Leveraging the data we collected with GOOG-411, the Google speech team built its own speech recognition engine. We were looking for interesting use cases for testing. It was the spring of 2008 and the presidential campaign was in high-gear. We realized that this could be a really cool application. We partnered with YouTube to have access to the videos of the republican and democratic campaigns and we builts a gadget for i-Google to let people search videos. Later on, the gadget was "promoted" to its own page on Google Labs.

## One Today (Google.org, 2013)
OneToday is a mobile application we launched in April 2013 for Google.org. The key idea was to radically change the way people make donations. Instead of having people wait for the end of the year to pick the handful of organizations you will donate to, we tried to create a new habit where people could donate as often as once a day.

## Network of Innovators -- first version (NYU GovLab, 2015)
The [Network of Innovators](https://networkofinnovators.org) is a knowledge-exchange network for open government and open data professionals, where you can:

* Ask a question or discuss all things open data & government,
* Find & connect with innovators to get advice on your projects,
* Get matched with others who have experience in what you want to learn!

# Social Impact and For-Good Projects

## Data for Good Exchange (2015-)
<img style="float: right; max-width:20%;" src="img/d4gx-logo.jpg" alt="Data for Good Exchange">

I was part of the founding team with Gideon Mann and Susan Kish (both at Bloomberg at the time). 
I was the program chair of the Bloomberg Data For Good Exchange for 4 years (2015-2018).

For the first few years, our main concern was to get enough paper submissions and we strongly encouraged our program committee  (including myself) to submit papers.
* ["Birds in the Clouds": Adventures in Data Engineering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.08521.pdf), with Nicolas Cherel et al. (2017).
* [Internet Scale Research Studies using SDL-Rx](https://data.bloomberglp.com/company/sites/2/2016/09/paper_69.pdf), with James Kizer et al. (2016).
* P x B + D > C: a “calculus” for Open Data, with David Sangokoya (2015).
* "Docker" for (open)data, with John Krauss (2015).

I was also deeply involved in the D4GX efforts to create a code of ethics ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8qjmImu1LQ&t=94s)).

## Debugging Politics hackathon (2017)
Over the course of a long week-end, we built Influenza, a tool to find "patterns of influence" in politics: (1) we create a graph of the US political system using open data and (2) we query the graph to find "bugs".

## NYU-AD hackathon (2013-2016)
I started as a mentor, then judge, then co-organizer with Prof Sana Odeh, 4 years in a row.
* Ideation deck (2015)

## Google OneToday (2013)
(see above)

# Data Science
I have been involved in various activities related to data science, including tools, lectures, and presentations.

## Google CoLab (2013-)
I started a new inititiave with Gideon Mann at Google Research, initally focused on Big Civic Data. After doing market resarch and user interviews, we realized that the real need was for a collaborative platform for data science, hence CoLab. I stumbled upon the open source iPython project and realized this could be a great starting point. First, we modified the code to make it run in the Google infrastructure and it was used by Kayur Patel to teach the first Machine Learning class at Google. Gideon, Kayur and I left Google. The tool then got a life of its own, being used by lots of people at Google, before it got productized as Google CoLab in October 2017.

## Gov Lab's ["Solving Public Problems with Data: Platforms and Where to Store the Data?"](https://sppd.thegovlab.org/lectures/platforms-and-where-to-store-the-data.html) (2018)
I was invited by Gov Lab to talk about "the state of the art in technologies for collecting, storing, analyzing and visualizing data."
