My passion is to invent, architect and build products that leverage technology to solve meaningful problems and have a large social impact. I aim at empowering people and organizations to be more productive and collaborative through innovation.


Until recently, I was working for [Gro Intelligence](https://gro-intelligence.com/) as their SVP of Product (Platform).
