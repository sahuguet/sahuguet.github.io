My passion is to invent, architect and build products that leverage technology to solve mean- ingful problems and have a large social impact. I aim at empowering people and organizations to be more productive and collaborative through innovation.

My areas of expertise include data – big, small, open, geographic – management and anal- ysis, architecture of complex systems, product design and research & development.

I am currently working for the Jacobs Institute at Cornell Tech where I am the project lead for the Urban Tech hub.
